# Dino Soar ðŸ¦–

A Python implementation of the Chrome browser's offline dinosaur runner game, built using Pygame.

## Description

Dino Soar is a partial clone of Chrome's famous no-network dinosaur game where players control a running dinosaur, jumping over cacti and ducking under pterodactyls to achieve the highest possible score.

## Features

- Progressive difficulty scaling
- Sound effects
- Keyboard controls for jump and duck actions

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
